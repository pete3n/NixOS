I will provide some specific information about a web app requirements, and it will be your job to come up with an architecture and code for developing secure app with Typscript and React. The backend will consist of a Node.js server written in Typscript. The backend database with be MongoDB. Both the node server and MongoDB with be running in docker containers, which will be created with docker-compose. The frontend will communicate with the backend with a REST API for CRUD functions. The API will pass data formatted in JSON. The frontend should provide an easy interface for users to query data. Admin users should be able to create, update, and delete data, as well as modify schema. I would prefer that users and admins not have to remember passwords for accounts."
